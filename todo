Example tweets that need to work:

https://twitter.com/fazlalizadeh/status/410088541100584960

Set up pagination button on userfeed to dynamically make api calls

Todo:
  - If user already logged in then logged out, check for 'one click login', else option to log in as diff user
  - Find original tweet rather than RT
